After making a simple blog with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, I decided to take things further with this website project.
With guidance from Claude 3.5 inside GitHub Copilot, I used Next.js to add functionality like a working contact form, and Tailwind CSS with Framer Motion for a more lively and clean UI.
Throughout the project, I stayed focused on writing semantic and SEO-friendly prompts to make sure the site is accessible, fast, and search-engine ready.
